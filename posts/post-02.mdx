### Creating a new project

To create a Next.js app, open your terminal, cd into the folder you'd like to keep your project, and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example"
```

This command uses create-next-app, a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that sets up a Next.js application for you. In the command above, you're also using the --example flag with the starter example for this course.

### Exploring the project

Unlike tutorials that have you write code from scratch, much of the code for this course is already written for you. This better reflects real-world development, where you'll likely be working with existing codebases.

Our goal is to help you focus on learning the main features of Next.js, without having to write all the application code.

After installation, open the project in your code editor and navigate to nextjs-dashboard.

```bash
cd nextjs-dashboard
```
Let's spend some time exploring the project.


### Folder structure

You'll notice that the project has the following folder structure:
